# Notes for John Romero (Instructor)

I tried to make the actual report fairly short and have connecting files if needed. This was because I read in many places that this is more geared towards non technical people.

Additionally, I heavily based the course on the PicoCTF challenge "UnforgottenBits". This is because I wanted to use a real disk image with real file analysis. I spent many hours trying to figure this challenge out and it had many parts to it. I thought it would fit well with the Mock Report. Additionally, I made some changes to the story that are completly fictional and have nothing to do with the story from "UnforgottenBits".

No standard format. It's particular to agency.
