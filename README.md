# Notes

I tried to make the actual report fairly short and have connecting files if needed. This was because I read in many places that this is more geared towards non technical people.

Additionally, I heavily based the course on the PicoCTF challenge "UnforgottenBits". This is because I wanted to use a real disk image with real file analysis. I spent many hours trying to figure this challenge out and it had many parts to it. I thought it would fit well with the Mock Report. Additionally, I made some changes to the story that are completly fictional and have nothing to do with the story from "UnforgottenBits".

# What I learned

* How to write a Digital Forensics report
* How to fill out a Chain of Custody Form
* How to fill out a Digital Investigation Log
* A lot about using autopsy on a technical digital forensics case (PicoCTF 2023 - UnforgottenBits). Also how to convey the technical notes after completing a challenge or digital forensics case. Also while working on UnforgottenBits I used other tools like stegcracker, steghide, openssl, linux cli, python scripting, and more.
* How to autogenerate reports with OSForensics and Autopsy.
* How to implment the information from the forensics presentation about taking images in context of Digitial Forensics. Even pictures that weren't clear or good were saved and not altered in any way (metadata is still there). Also I took many images from multiple angles and zoom.
* Similar cases such as Operation Bayonet and The Silk Road.
* Github formatting techniques

---

I couldn't really find any standard format and as mentioned in the linkedin learning video it is particular to each agency. Due to this I combined mutliple different formats from the sources provided.
