The site ```totallynotadrugonlinemarketplace.onion``` is one of the largest online druge marketplaces in the United States. It was beleived and later confirmed that Yone played a critical part in created this marketplace.

Here are some statistics that the FBI had found in connection to this drug marketplace: 

* 2901 Hospitilized Adults
* 781 Hospitilized Children

These connection were able to be made because there is a mark on the drugs that the DEA helped identify.

# Acknowledgements

I'd like to acknowledge the team that made this possible. Digital forensics is not an individual task it requires a team of dedicated people to go through many different avenues. With a diverse digital forensics team with many different people having different expertise, we were able to professionally and correctly analyze the files and connect them to the suspect.

I would also like to acknowledge all the investigative teams such as Bryan Police Department and the FBI who were the ones to get the laptop in the first place. It would not have been possible without them.

Lastly, I would like to acknowledge the lawyers working hard to get the people responsible for this.
